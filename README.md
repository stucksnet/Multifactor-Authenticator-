# Multifactor-Authenticator-
The Website Authenticator is a customizable multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution that adds an extra layer of security. Users verify their identity using something they know (password) and something they have (one-time code via SMS, email, or an authenticator app), ensuring safe access.
